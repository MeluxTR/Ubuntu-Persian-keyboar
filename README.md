# Ubuntu-Persian-keyboard
this project about Persian Keyboard in Ubuntu. As I tried before , I could n't type "#" sign and "_"  in fa default keybord. Also I was chaged the "Ù¾" character to the right location of keyboard.

So you can replace easly " ir " form to right place of you root folder and reboot the system.
