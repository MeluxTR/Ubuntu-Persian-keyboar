# Ubuntu-Persian-keyboard

this project is about Persian Keyboard in Ubuntu. As I tried before, I couldn't type the "#" sign and "_" in fa default keyboard. Also, I was charged the "پ" character to the right keyboard location.


So you can easily replace " ir " form in the right place of your root folder and reboot the system.





#### DO IT NOW ###

First of all copy ir file and replace them with this directory of your system. 


Directory is: $: /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ir


and after that, reboot your system and enjoy it.

1. you have # sign, when you press Shit+3

2. you have _ sign, When you press Shitf+-

3. you have پ character, on the left of Inter Button

4. you have ئ character, in the M Button

5. you have ، character, when you press Shift+7
